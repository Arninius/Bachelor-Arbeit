1. Without delays: Increase of information with neuron population size (square root)
2. With delays: Natalie and Grewe papers
3. Single frequencies with cosine-weights (derivation from DFT and iDFT with t = 0 at given frequency)
4. Frequency spectrum with cosine-weights, too much noise
5. Fourier-Combine as noise cancelling extension of cosine-weights, superiority
6. Consequences for receptive field sizes (always detrimental, but for lower frequencies, larger fields are tolerable)
